## Question Intentions & Psychology

### Discovery Questions - Why We Ask Them

**"Walk me through your current process"**

- *What to listen for*: Manual tasks, time-consuming research, bottlenecks

**"What's your biggest bottleneck in scaling?"**
- *Intention*: Identify the core business pain we can solve
- *What to listen for*: Team size limits, time constraints, quality concerns

**"What tools are you currently using?"**
- *Intention*: Understand current spend and integration needs

## Common Objections & Responses

### "We prefer human-only work"
**Response**: "I understand. Berlin actually enhances human expertise rather than replacing it. Our AI handles the research and prioritization, but humans make the final decisions and handle execution. Think of it as giving your team a very smart research assistant."

### "Pricing concerns"
**Response**: "I get it. Let's look at it this way - if Berlin saves your team 15 hours per week per client, and your team costs $50/hour, that's $750 in savings per client per week. The ROI becomes clear pretty quickly."

### "Already have tools"
**Response**: "That makes sense. Most of our clients were using multiple tools before Berlin. The difference is integration - instead of jumping between 5 different tools, Berlin brings it all together and tells you exactly what to do next."

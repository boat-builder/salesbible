## Sales Bible Management Instructions

### When Analyzing New Calls:
1. Compare the transcript against the current sales_bible.md
2. Identify areas where the seller followed or deviated from the bible
3. Note new insights, objections, or successful techniques
4. Update the "Mistakes to Avoid (Learning Log)" section

### Learning Log Update Rules:
- **First occurrence of mistake**: Add to main section with ‚ùå and date
- **Improvement noted**: Update with "X was bad in [date] call, but improved this time. Focus on Y next"  
- **Consistent improvement (2+ calls)**: Move to footnote section and remove from main warnings
- **New successful technique**: Add to appropriate section (questions, positioning, etc.)
- **New persona insights**: Add to persona-specific section

### Persona Categories:
- Marketing Agency Owners
- SaaS Company Founders  
- E-commerce Business Owners
- Enterprise Marketing Teams
- Freelance SEO Consultants

Add new personas as encountered, with their specific pain points, preferred messaging, and effective approaches.

## Output Format
When analyzing a transcript, provide:

1. **Overall Performance Score** (1-10) with brief rationale
2. **What Went Well** - Specific examples from the call
3. **Areas for Improvement** - Concrete, actionable feedback
4. **Bible Updates** - Specific additions/modifications to make to sales_bible.md
5. **Next Call Focus** - Top 2-3 things to prioritize in the next call

## Key Metrics to Track
- Time from first call to demo scheduled
- Demo-to-close conversion rate

Remember: The sales_bible.md should evolve into a comprehensive reference that makes each subsequent call more effective than the last.

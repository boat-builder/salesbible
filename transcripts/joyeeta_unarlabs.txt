Speaker 1

Today, 12:03 AM
Hello?
Hello?
Hello, Sherin? Hey. Can you hear me?
Speaker 2

Today, 12:03 AM
Yes. I can. Can you hear
Speaker 1

Today, 12:03 AM
me?
Yes. This is Joita. Just one second. Alright. Yes.
So you today?
Speaker 3

Today, 12:03 AM
Doing well. How are you doing
Speaker 1

Today, 12:03 AM
today?
Good. Good. So I reached out because I read that blog. That was very, very interesting.
And I'm wondering if you had any more put any more thought into this, and I would like to hear exactly how or how can we achieve some targeting and if you like, how do you work, basically? Like, consulting or product?
Speaker 3

Today, 12:04 AM
Got it. Which blog? We did The HoneyPort one?
Speaker 1

Today, 12:04 AM
Mhmm. Yes. Honeypot one.
Speaker 3

Today, 12:04 AM
Oh, I see. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Got it.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:04 AM
Got it.
Speaker 2

Today, 12:04 AM
Got it.
Speaker 3

Today, 12:04 AM
Yeah. That was one of the experience. So we did we do do a a couple of experiments because the the the the space is evolving way too fast. We can't pick on any signals from all this top companies or tools. Well, there are certain things that he could, but there are certain things he can't. So for Mhmm. The Honeypot one, reveal is a bunch of information that so I basically went and spoke to one of the like, dog crawlers or people who are crawler experts in the world, and nobody had thought about what we were doing. So all of them found it very interesting. Yeah. So that was one of those items. The way we operate is we have been running an agency since '21.
And then we sort of converted all the automations that we were doing into a SaaS. So so the agency which we we now and then moving everyone to the SaaS operation.
So part Okay. Operation is mostly because the agency thing was like, 95% ran by humans.
Now we are trying to get to most of it run by an AI agent, but sort of guided by humans.
And we also try to do We
Speaker 1

Today, 12:05 AM
people on your team right now? Like, how how big is this agency?
Speaker 2

Today, 12:06 AM
So
Speaker 3

Today, 12:06 AM
so the agency thing or operating with a couple of outsource vendors as well in in India. The team is basically me here in Bangalore and my cofounder in New York. And then two other people. But the two other people doesn't really involve in day to day ops. They're mostly doing your research on the marketing side. And what are the playbooks and depends on the industry because we work with the people in different segments.
We we all of them are beat but different industries.
I have different way to like, it's mostly a same playbook, but the application of the playbook for a COG is different from industry to industry. So for example Mhmm.
Space. Right? It is very relevant. For some space, YouTube is where people go to mostly. So the Mhmm. Trends would have drastic impact on how you apply that playbook.
Okay. So this is very the two people to more research on that. So it's just four of us and then outsourced the vendors. But we are not the the the company that we are forming for outsourcing anymore. We are not driven part, but it's mostly giving to the LLMs.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:07 AM
I see. So
Speaker 3

Today, 12:07 AM
Sorry. Go on.
Sorry. I lost you. I can't hear you. Sorry.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:07 AM
Oh, how would the SaaS platform work now? Like,
Speaker 3

Today, 12:07 AM
Yeah. So so as I said, we were we we were we are still on the migration process. That's why you don't see much of marketing materials from us in the socials.
Because we can't handle the scale yet. It's all human driven. Okay. Paid work is we have, like, a smaller tier where so well, in a month when we completely roll out, asset platform, Our plan is to have three TOs. One is the which that is Mhmm. Connect your platform and we give you the basic analytics. The second tier is strategy. That Mhmm. Vendasta, the strategization, so build and take a playbook. Which we continuously or the playbook is being evolved by our research.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:08 AM
And Mhmm. Exports
Speaker 3

Today, 12:08 AM
insights. So Boldly take a playbook can apply that to your domain. And then Mhmm. Monitoring your like, thousands of signals, which the IT people, SEO team would do, but they they do very less frequent because like, a lot of human labor.
But an LLM can do, you know, like, a thousand signal monitoring on a daily basis. So we do those monitoring and we so if, let's say, we found that JWT is not looking at ready anymore, So that's a playbook. So we are the the lumps would start following that playbook from the next moment onwards.
Right?
So the playbook goes and those custom instructions comes from the user or our human counterparts.
So the pay label being applied to the domain and then berlin Berlin make the strategies speaker. And then Okay. The company would go and execute the strategies. Right? So the second tier, which is strategy. The third Mhmm. Is done for your execution. We basically take care of the end as far as it affects your SEO, And then, you know, basically, yeah, everything. Whether video or everything.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:09 AM
So I don't know if you already looked at our web like, what was in your impression? Like, what did you see where
Speaker 3

Today, 12:10 AM
Yeah. Yeah. So two things. One, it's an it's a niche that I did not really know has a business opportunity on.
Mhmm. That was an insight for me. From an SEO perspective, I I think the industry itself is not like, will so if you look at the CEO profile of competitors that I found. So MathCicle is one. There University based attempts.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:10 AM
Yeah. So when you when you found MathKeeper, did you do, like, a physically just search, or do you use one of your tools? Like, how exactly did you come up with EquatIO and MathJigger?
Speaker 3

Today, 12:10 AM
Yeah. So so we so for that particular instance, I went to public city and asked, So what did Mhmm. Companies, on the back end our tool is also gonna do the same thing.
But the tool what the tool does is a continuous process. Right? So, basically, it does running every time it does scan the Internet. And audience signals. And then if it finds a new competitor tomorrow, it would alert you. But I've complexity. I know what this does and then try to ask to find a couple of competitors. But then I also Mhmm. Did more digging today, and I found things that did not really come about. I I think dusmosis is one. You should know Dusmo.
Speaker 2

Today, 12:11 AM
Right? Dusmo.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:11 AM
Yeah? Yeah. Desmos calculator. Yeah. So
Speaker 3

Today, 12:11 AM
Yep. Now the
Speaker 1

Today, 12:11 AM
reason I some.
Speaker 3

Today, 12:11 AM
So I don't so I think the today's resource is getting so I have, like, at least 10, 12 brand products that could be your competitors in the large scheme. But
Speaker 2

Today, 12:11 AM
See,
Speaker 1

Today, 12:11 AM
that's really actually my question and my concern too. The reason is when people search, like, it does bring up all these tools, but it doesn't like, I'm I'm wondering why it is bucketed with those tools because something is missing in terms of either the messaging or the language that you know, when when you talk about graphics accessibility, Desmos is an accessible use you know, needing an accessible way to graph would use that. But that's not at all what Morph does No. I see.
Speaker 3

Today, 12:12 AM
Like, From, like, a very high level because I did not really dig into it.
What I see what I could what I could think of is as if you go and search in Google, of topics that are relevant to you, you probably come up in the top three. Right? Which is what I heard. Mhmm. But if you ask an l lum, you would still probably come up with the top three, but LLM is not picking you. Because you don't really give enough signal that you are an authority.
So if you look at all those things that come up, that is actually not the right answer to the trust team.
Probably the right answer to the question. But they are coming up because they are big brands or big products or have it be have been long time, have goods Mhmm. And secured Internet presence. People have been talking about it. I'm assuming I haven't really dig into it, but looking from outside, that's what I see. So so two things. Right? So opportunity wise, we have what you have is a massive opportunity because none of the tools popping up are exactly what you guys do. So if you're core on what what you do and then mitra focus on that for not just your website. You need to have, like, a brand that other people If you do that, you will come up. And when you do that, and when the audience convert that with the second and third option comes up, there is no real comparison because you're obviously the answer to the questions that they're asking for. So if you you be ultra focused on that.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:14 AM
Okay. So if I want the fact that so MathKeeper will give you, like, one format, and it will a the images and all, they don't get converted into accessible graphics. They stay as images in your document.
Sometimes, it it will detect images. Sometimes, it doesn't even detect images. It only handles the text and the math, right, in a Word document. Right. But with our platform, you can get multiple formats. You can get a you know, So The challenge is many users of ours may also even not know that this is how you can access this particular piece of information.
Like, they they know that they cannot act they cannot act they cannot access x document, but they don't know how to make that into an a form that they can use.
And and then the search is not giving pointing that out for us either. Right?
So I think that there are couple of pointers here. One is we we want to target but we also want to revise We also want very clear signals like how did how can I wonder if something you have can give us very clear idea of this is why your you know, like, you're not getting found? Right.
Yes. We are not found in search. We know we have lot optimize optimize, how do we know that now we are going to be found or this is a particular reason why we are not being found?
Speaker 3

Today, 12:15 AM
So so we could find with good certainty that why the other results are coming up.
Okay. That's already something that we can figure out with our two
Speaker 1

Today, 12:16 AM
Yeah. Foolproof.
Speaker 3

Today, 12:16 AM
But it should give you a very good act with pretty good certainty. Now Mhmm. That would basically answer the question of why you are not found. And Mhmm. We do and it's probably not just one signal zero. We would find one signal and let's we optimize for that. We improve our position a bit, then we find something else. We optimize for that. So it's like a a iterative process that we have to do for force for some time. But even before and the sometime is not, like, a year. Right? Sometimes it's not, like, like, much shorter, like, lifespan. But also, even before, the site itself has to be in a good position It should have a good site hierarchy. It should basic social presence. Again, socials means not all the socials especially since we are optimizing for search. Engine, only the socials that are accessible to search engines. Right? So for example, Facebook is not Right? It's not the API is not very listed It's open, but it's not listed in the search. But right you we need to find out those solutions that has impact on the audience that we are focusing on and and optimize some presence on those socials.
Yeah.
And then to answer the second question, how do we know if it helped is we so one of the thing that we do is we list a bunch of things that people would typically search for. And then Mhmm. Search that we call the APIs of LLMs. With those prompts once Mhmm.
Problems.
Prompts, and we basically sort of track whether we are dropping you or coming up. And based on that, we we could basically see if that's happening. Just once it a note. But at the end of the day, what matters is people coming to your website or you be shown up in the search results or whether you're getting conversions. So obviously that number has to go up. So that's that's that if if if you don't have an analytics put on that place, that's probably the first thing that we have to do. And when we that and if we do this right, that should also go up.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:18 AM
Okay. So how does this work? You connect to the you have a say, our website? Or how how would it it? Getting this kind of data?
Speaker 3

Today, 12:18 AM
Right. Yeah. So we typically for both TOs, what we do is we connect with your Google Analytics. If you have set up Google Analytics, We do also connect to your Google search. Consultancy have set up that. If you don't if we highly, highly recommend you should. Oh, in fact, the about 60% of the platform's feature doesn't work if you don't So you regardless of whether you are going to use Berlin or not, you should use both analytic rule and text and search console. And then everything else so if if your website is blocking boards and crawlers, we would ask you to remove that block. But you your site is
Speaker 1

Today, 12:19 AM
But that has So it is not. Right? Like, because we didn't build in any any special
Speaker 3

Today, 12:19 AM
Yeah. You should actually. So there are couple of fundamental issues. You don't have a robust story. T x t. You don't have a site map dot XML file.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:26 AM
So that's another challenge, which is why our the messaging that we want to really go out with is not that you can convert a math document. That's not the real like you can customize. This is so what we are working on now is expanding the platform so that you can now the organizations that need to provide it. Let's say university. Whatever content it has. It can make it available in various formats.
Optimize for different personas. Like, if they have students who have some accommodations they need for you know, for for dyslexia or ADHD or something.
Because your because the platform is able to, you know, extract
Speaker 2

Today, 12:27 AM
and re
Speaker 1

Today, 12:27 AM
generate content in the form that's optimized for these individuals. So there's a bigger benefit for integrating it across So that's the future materials we want to produce is for that. But I think the lesson that we still have to learn as a start up is even with the one that we have, we don't even know that we have reached everyone that needed to know about the product. So you know, and see some impact from it, we will know better how to you know, revise our
Speaker 2

Today, 12:27 AM
method.
Speaker 3

Today, 12:27 AM
Makes sense. So okay. So from you described, my next question was how were you handling marketing and what was working and what not. But what I'm understanding you
Speaker 2

Today, 12:28 AM
We do
Speaker 1

Today, 12:28 AM
sorry. I forgot one other data point. We have a marketing partner who generate a newsletter, and they send it out to their distributor list. And we've had a few leads from that, not not too significant.
But that is because all the lots of resellers have come and talked to us about reselling this product in their markets. And and we have another collaboration going in Canada because of that. I don't know if it will finally lead to something, but some lead generation from that.
Speaker 3

Today, 12:28 AM
Okay. So I have a bunch of questions more, but I don't know if you have time. Do you have, like, a few minutes more?
Speaker 1

Today, 12:28 AM
Let me check.
Yeah. I do. I have time until four. Okay. Like,
Speaker 3

Today, 12:28 AM
just try to wrap up this discussion, and then we'll go to the questions. So from your description, what I think again, I haven't gone deep, but based on my experience doing marketing for about four years. I think two very good channels that he had he can target, especially if you are targeting parents. Two channels are one is Instagram slash slash TikTok.
Where so that's sort of you're trying to do an outbound. To your ICP. And Instagram and TikTok algorithm are very good at so you basically have to find influencers in the space that you're many micro influencers. They don't really Mhmm. The videos. But you look at the video, type the the two, which are liked by the parents of the kids that you are you are target audience are. And then Mhmm. Basically make similar videos, right, or make similar posts. You can ask the micro influencers to help you out as well.
Now that would create an outbound reach. But what happens is majority of those parents are gonna go and search Google. So you need to have, like, a channel where I mean, so this this not really SEO per se. It's just, you know, you need to have, like, a good first version where they search for you not you know, you know, Did I do I pronounce it correctly? Is it you not lapsed? Or morph?
Speaker 1

Today, 12:30 AM
We're not lapse.
Speaker 2

Today, 12:30 AM
Yeah.
Speaker 3

Today, 12:30 AM
So when when you should be coming up with an as an authority rather than, you know, one link among other 10 links.
So and yeah. So that's probably a good marketing channel that you have to do an outbound and outbound. So I think the see, the benefit of doing everything on the site is everyone, whatever stream that you're gonna use, everyone is gonna land there. So yours.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:30 AM
Land
Speaker 2

Today, 12:30 AM
there. Like,
Speaker 3

Today, 12:30 AM
your site, search engine profile has to be good. Nobody's gonna well, it's a very unlikely scenario where does somebody go and type the URL out. Probably gonna do a search.
Brand search. Right? So brand optimizing for brand search has to be a priority, but it's not a very hard hard task because the name is not very common name.
Search for Rona Labs, you would come up So brand search has to be optimized, but non brand search also. The site has to be good. Then do a lot of outbound. Whether doing invest so this is like a three to six months of, SEO activity and then well, you need to figure out if the outbound activity would work or not. Just a theory. Right? Books, then I think
Speaker 1

Today, 12:33 AM
You know, we can like, I can get in on a call with someone and tell like, I've tried it both myself. Yeah. And I've tried it with other person. Like, get out of call. And in in the case of sometimes engaging another person is we don't I feel like I've not had enough value. Ultimately, I end up doing the content. Like, the thing. And they do some may do some may do some story something something which we can already get from OpenAI or whatever. So then then the question is, like, ultimately, it is our own standards so so we end up we end up doing all of this ourselves ourselves, and that's a that's a good like a like a like a bandwidth for
Speaker 2

Today, 12:33 AM
us.
Speaker 3

Today, 12:33 AM
I mean, yeah, it's a full time job.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:33 AM
Yeah. So so then I don't know if when you said other other people, like, know, like, will they be doing if
Speaker 3

Today, 12:34 AM
Good because it was the while we were working on data in test it first and then we And Put the KPIs. Again, depends on the type of Four Tyres at 99 and the higher Tyres at triple nine. We are planning to use the 99 to 49 because we are automated we have automated a lot of these things.
You to have a team to execute it, you could hire a contract and then exit just what Berlin suggests.
The done for you, Tyrese, triple nine, are planning to increase that to one two nine nine. Triple nine?
Speaker 1

Today, 12:36 AM
For for the
Speaker 3

Today, 12:36 AM
For a month of everything we do we do for you. But we are planning to increase that to one two nine nine? Because, like, the the the content that we need to generate Like, with the people that we are doing, we realized the content that we generate requires more effort. So
Speaker 4

Today, 12:36 AM
we Mhmm. At
Speaker 3

Today, 12:36 AM
least that two point two nine nine. But the existing people are still on triple nine.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:36 AM
I see. So the this is per month, the $999 per month. Right? Then
Speaker 3

Today, 12:36 AM
information is, it's a extremely hard to quantify the effort. So we have come up with because, you know, some blocks were for video required more effort. A technical fix on your website require a different effort. So we sort of come up with an internal pointing system, which describe to you.
And so triple line is for two fifty
Speaker 1

Today, 12:37 AM
So do I just fine. I mean, I know kind of the complexity of this and how many different skill sets need to be involved.
But I think the I'm still wondering, like, if we should start with, like, a smaller tier. You can give us the fixes. We just take them on and on as you know, things that we have to do and optimize. Yeah. And then if, you know, we get to a point where we see that, you know, this is not working as fast as yeah. And we can move to different tier at that point.
Speaker 3

Today, 12:37 AM
So something that we are plan so if that is something that you can consider, Right. We have been thinking and just come up with all a lot of I think, all the people, the people who are on the lower tier lower tier is that if they can add hook, assign some
Speaker 2

Today, 12:38 AM
of the
Speaker 3

Today, 12:38 AM
of the tasks. So they are still on the smaller tier, but they can say, oh, this we can't do. We'll pay x amount just for this task.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:38 AM
Yeah. Yeah. That that would be a good option to have.
Speaker 3

Today, 12:38 AM
Yeah. Yeah. We are very seriously concerned Not yet could happen because it comes up a lot. I mean, it's just that problem the only problem with that here is because we are also a lit year sorry. Early early company and we are experimenting with a lot of there's uncertainty. Like, how many tasks we get a month? How many people should we hire? Right? So maybe in a place where maybe after next month when we scale up our marketing, when we have, like, a 50 clients or 100 clients, Just possible feasible scenario to execute. But right now, it's a bit of an uncertain.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:39 AM
Okay. No. No. The that's fine. Completely makes sense. But I think, you know, before we you know, before I spoke to you, we in our team, we did some research on that SEO, GU aspect, and we had a few tasks kind of sitting on our you know, on our road map to do.
Would this I mean, you you are probably in in that do like, not done for us model. You would you would share some prerequisites with us. Right? Like, you need to have x l you know, or x number of things done before it will be effective for us to engage or how does it work? Like, how do you share what you need to make sure that you're, like, you know, what you're what the agent is doing is successful.
Speaker 3

Today, 12:39 AM
Right. Let me see if there is a brand that I
Speaker 2

Today, 12:40 AM
owe you.
Speaker 3

Today, 12:40 AM
Do you mind if I share the screen quickly?
Speaker 1

Today, 12:40 AM
Yeah. Sure. Sure.
Speaker 3

Today, 12:40 AM
Let me know if you can see my screen. See my screen.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:40 AM
Mhmm. Again. Again.
Again. Again.
Speaker 3

Today, 12:40 AM
Okay. So this is a So Accessibility formats for visually impaired or different kind of this is ADHD. So all of those are different different topics.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:44 AM
I have a question. So, you know, as I mentioned that we are trying to broaden the like, just to give understanding that the platform that we have can do actually much you may be able to do. Yeah. On the app at a given point. So how do we feel that information into the agent?
Speaker 3

Today, 12:44 AM
Right. So ways. Sorry. There are multiple ways.
A chat or email interface that you can just email to or chat to Berlin and then Berlin would take care of the rest. And for the particular question that you asked, you can just come here and add a new topic. So for this guy's it's anxiety treatment and ADHD management. Those are the two topics that they have. So those are the are the only topics Berlin is optimizing for. Tomorrow, if you come and add a third topic, Berlin would start optimizing for that It all happens automatically. You don't really have to do anything else. So you would start with just one or two topics, which are the only thing that you're you're doing right now. Then a month in a month when you launch a new thing, you add that as a topic.
But also note that well, the two fifty points is you would spread too thin for for more topics, so you would probably have to increase the number of points that Boeing would generate if you increase the well, I mean, when we reach there, I can talk about that. A bit more detail. Yeah. I just wanted to show, like, other actions So this is a social media act. So, like, you know, going and doing a Reddit activity.
This is a site issue. They had an issue with the metadata on the site. It's like a h one spacing issue.
This is a landing page. It's not a blog page. Let's see. It's like a brand new landing page that they created because Berlin Berlin suggested this. Berlin Berlin suggested that having a landing page is good. This is a review. Getting a review from just dialed because the review was not good. You they had to get a patient review and just dial. So, yeah, so like I said, there was, like, 57 action points. So reviews, YouTube videos, Reddit, blog post, technical issues. It's like about eight or nine or ten nine different technical issues.
Yeah. So 57 kind of issues that we are right now recommending, but we are so right now, the focus is to automate those It's like a lot of math. There were a lot of manual activities involved. But we are getting into a place where Berlin can do all of this by itself. And then we wanted to increase that 57 to how much ever or whatever is important as per our playbook. So our playbook gets just gets keep updating. So whenever our playbook has a as in a section where we don't have a capability on, We sort of get the notification, and then we go and pull that capability.
Apart from what we already had in the agency, And the agency mode were all was already in the working, so it was pretty easy for us to migrate them to this mode. So there's a lot of uncertainty on the pricing. Like, everything else is clear for us. There's a lot of uncertainty on the pricing. But we are we decided to eat the loss if we are gonna have loss and then basically figure out what's gonna what's gonna be. So the increase from triple nine to $1.02 double 9 is
Speaker 2

Today, 12:48 AM
sort of
Speaker 3

Today, 12:48 AM
feedback feedback that we have got from working on this more for a few months.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:48 AM
You mean people wanted you to did you increase the price the price?
Speaker 3

Today, 12:48 AM
No. No. No. No. No. We just figured out we can't we can't We cannot. Yeah. We can't do because the human cost when it comes to deep work is a bit more than we anticipated. We we did not anticipate this much work on blog content and video content. That's exact reason.
Yeah.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:49 AM
That is always a big sync.
Okay. So this is a a great information. Thank you for sharing with me. So I think let me take this Is it possible for you to do, like, a trial or, like, share like, for example, at this point, what are the findings? Or you know or rather, actually, I need to connect like, the analytics and the console And I'm wondering if it is possible for you to produce the kind of findings that or anything that would would be, like, I wanna take this back and I I know that the do it yourself DIY pricing is something that should not be a problem at all. Yeah.
But I still wanna get a kind of, like, a view view on how much work that is even if we know? Yeah. And and be able to have some way to mechanism to act on act on it and what that involves. Right? So I think I'm wondering if
Speaker 5

Today, 12:55 AM
But I can send those questions your way, or may maybe we can we can set up a follow-up call. Like, how do you do you wanna block so if how how how how does the next step look like to you?
Speaker 6

Today, 12:56 AM
I think you you know, the subscription, I think that's what you said. Right? Because go for a month subscription. Right. Right? And for is
Speaker 5

Today, 12:56 AM
that that's it? Maybe we can do like, again, set up a call sometime next week or this week towards the end. Or if you or if you need to discuss that with the CEO and then make a decision. Then you can let me know.
Speaker 6

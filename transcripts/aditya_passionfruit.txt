Yes. I can hear you. How are you doing?
Speaker 2

Today, 12:02 AM
Hey. Doing well, man. Thanks. How are
Speaker 1

Today, 12:02 AM
you? Doing lovely. Doing lovely. Where are you joining in from? Bangalore.
Oh, lovely. Lovely. You from? New York. New York. New York.
Speaker 2

Today, 12:02 AM
Hi, Adam. How long since you're in New York?
Speaker 1

Today, 12:02 AM
So, I mean, it's been now, what, about five years? But split my time between Delhi, Bombay, and New York City cinema.
Speaker 2

Today, 12:03 AM
My cofounder is in New York.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:03 AM
Oh, really? Yeah. I went to The
Speaker 2

Today, 12:03 AM
location. I think it's somewhere close to Buffalo.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:03 AM
Okay. Okay. Yeah. Fair. Fair. Fair. Lovely. Lovely. Well, Shareen, thank you for taking out the time.
Got the chance to check our company out. But we're doing a bunch of stuff around, agentic flows and tooling but primarily as a service company.
And kind of came across your post on LinkedIn. And then I started exploring Berlin and and thought the tech you guys have built seemed very interesting. But I could get very little off the product on on on the trial. So I wanted to kind of understand kind of where you guys are at with the product, and we'd love to see it and see if we can start using it to service our clients. And that's something you guys are interested in.
Speaker 2

Today, 12:04 AM
Yeah. Absolutely. So I did take a look at the website. So we have about 30% of our clients being agencies, marketing agencies. So we do serve people who help other people with marketing. But I want to understand, you know, the the space that you guys are operating at, the CoinDeo. At least the CoinDeo that you are initially planning to use Billing for, and and I when I look at looked at the passion fruit side, nice name between I do see you guys do a bunch AI stuff, so I wanted to understand what are the overlaps and what are what exactly Berlin can or or where exactly Berlin can pull the gap.
So I, unfortunately, I don't really have a way to show you the demo without revealing one of the clients. Dashboard. But what I could do is take some information from you in this call and either set up a follow-up call or send you a little video that you can take a take a look and explore. Does that work?
Speaker 1

Today, 12:05 AM
Yeah. 70. 70. So I think what happens here generally is I think what we're struggling with is the delegation piece and the backlinking piece. That I saw here that you guys had where for a lot of work, where you can kind of add the tasks and then delegate them. Okay. Right? So oftentimes, what we have is it's like, we always don't have internal capacity. So oftentimes we have kind of find gaps to basically bridge that up. That I think having your comment, bridge that gap as well as be able to like, we don't have the tech in place to the level that you guys do. And for us, because we're expanding other channels, we were thinking what tech can we start using rather than having to build bring out ourselves. Makes sense. Because that, you know, people is biased and important Right. Currently, obviously, the clients were looking for using Berlin for is one of these mid market clients that we that we have, which are in the sweet spot where we don't have enough resources to meet to want Divvy up there. Yeah.
And for them, like, AI search is a bit too new, but of interest. And we don't wanna be creating instances, etcetera, for them just for AI search. So for that, I think having kept capacity increased capacity we all it seemed like kind of you guys have an internal team that I can assign work to. Right?
Speaker 2

Today, 12:06 AM
Of sort. Exactly. But yeah. So we'll we'll I'll I'll get that. Yeah. I'll let you finish. Sorry.
Yeah.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:06 AM
And I think overall just the task list that comes up across, I think it seemed like that it didn't YouTube search, etcetera, that you guys you guys are targeting with back linking being a key key part.
Was two areas that was of keen interest to us.
That I think we just struggle with today.
Speaker 2

Today, 12:07 AM
Alright. Really nice. So you said mid market. May I ask what segment or what industry they operate at? Is it ecommerce? Is it SaaS? Is it local business?
Speaker 1

Today, 12:07 AM
It's a mix of ecommerce and SaaS, but I'm primarily about this for ecommerce.
Speaker 2

Today, 12:07 AM
Okay. Makes sense.
Okay. So coming back to the question. So I what the way okay. Sorry. Let me take a pause and try to understand the process that you guys have for helping out the clients. So are you guys only doing SEO? Or GEO? Or is it, like, a mix of paid performance marketing and all of those? How does it work?
Speaker 1

Today, 12:07 AM
It makes across.
Speaker 2

Today, 12:07 AM
Okay. And so Berlin, we made as in a with a vision of making inbound marketing as a whole, not just SEO. But right now, we are only focusing in SEO. But with AI search, it's not just SEO. The things that you do around SEO just becomes part of the inbound. The the whole inbound strategy. So we do some bit like citations getting citations from Reddit or LinkedIn or things like that. Right? Now so when coming to SEO, could you give me, like, a very quick brief of how's your process? Like, does somebody sit down, analyze the tool, and figure out what tool like, how does it work?
Speaker 1

Today, 12:08 AM
Yeah. I mean, the traditional SEO process.
Speaker 2

Today, 12:08 AM
Okay. So it's is it only content writing and getting backlinks by sending emails or or buying backlinks or something? Are you guys doing anything more?
Speaker 1

Today, 12:08 AM
Almost the same.
Speaker 2

Today, 12:08 AM
Okay. Do you guys do programmatic SEO?
Speaker 1

Today, 12:08 AM
For a couple of clients, not really as as such because in the pages and stuff is pretty hard.
Speaker 2

Today, 12:08 AM
Got it.
And since you mentioned traditional, the way you figure out what to write on is basically looking at a tool, figuring out where where are the gaps that we can fill or what are the things that our competitors are ranking for and then just piggybacking on those.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:09 AM
Yep. Exactly.
Speaker 2

Today, 12:09 AM
Okay. Got it. Okay. So the way Berlin right now work is that it takes off the responsibility from your strategist on what to do. Which is our core competency, if you ask right now. And that is basically so one of the client that I review, like, today, was that last week, their task was to the the the things that build and figured out has high impact was to figure out two or three ready threads where our specific questions were asked. About seven blocks, and then one backlink and then a couple of technical SEO issues. Right? Do you guys do technical SEO as well? Yep. Okay. Great. Okay. So among the multitude of tasks that you could probably list out for a client, Berlin would sort of figure out what would work and for specifically AI search, but AI search optimize AI search is sort of a subset of traditional search engine optimization as well. Understood. So what we what Berlin does is Berlin has this knowledge base and then and agent in front of that knowledge base. This knowledge base is getting constantly updated within the experiments that we do or the experiments that we the industry does. Right? This knowledge goes into this knowledge base. There is an agent sitting in front of that. And then there is other agentic processes that so we have about 80 signals that we look at When when I say signals, that's basically your rank, your competitors' rank, some kind of performance, like, different things. And we have about 57 action categories that we Berlin, make suggestions for. And this is only well, most of them, about 90 percentage of them are come under the traditional org, the traditional SEO umbrella itself. Then there's a 10 percentage goes So So what does is it constantly asks the knowledge based agent and then apply this knowledge base results to the brand that works at that at that point. And then figures out what is what has highest impact. And then it takes that and then create a very detailed suggestion on what to do and then bring the suggestion to the dashboard. Right? So this is what we call as actions. So we we sort of figure out how much actions how how much action point is required for a depends on what level or what is their existing profile, what segment they are operating at, when what do you where the competitors are at. So let's say if the action point requires is 300 or 500 for a company, among the 57 actions that I mentioned, different action has different points. I basically start suggesting this point that this action is very specific to the brand.
Now the next piece that we wanna automate at this point is to take these actions.
Automate content writing to a great extent.
Backlink email sending to a great extent, but none of those complete. And then we start to automate different pieces of this But we can't really automate everything. For example, technical SEO is not something that we apply to get at all. A free tool creation is something that we automate, so we make a call to Lovable or CloudCall and things like that. Yeah. It's free tool and then to host it for people by calling Vorosil's API.
So so, yeah, so there are certain things that we automate and certain things that we don't. For the things that we don't, we sort of outsource to our human labor. But the goal is to take the human labor out the circle completely and then have agents do everything eventually, like, in five, six, seven down the line. Yep. Yeah. So that's the process right now. And if your focus is to outsource to human labor, maybe Berlin won't be a right fit because we are trying to get away from that.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:13 AM
So, I mean, the main thing here is, right, like, because AI is not there yet, across platforms, it's hard to move away from the human component. So the reason why we good is it's, like, the best we can use to transition out and then use this as we also expand our service arm where we bridge the gaps. And the thing is not about how much we use internally as human versus agentic. It's actually what the customer cares about. So the customer is I do I want a human involved. Well, okay. Right. Whatever takes the action, the human is reviewing the action and then choosing which action to take. So it kind of comes down to that competency. That's why we felt like there was a for us to partner up here and start using the product.
Speaker 2

Today, 12:14 AM
Right. So so there is two ways we can go about this. Right? One is just founder to founder. I can help you with the agencies that help help us doing the manual work so you can outsource to them. It's like a typical outsourcing business.
So you could do that. But if having an agent figure out the actions and automate like, about 90 percentage of it, and then a human would come man full in that percent. If that's something that you guys are interested in, then we can go to a route where Berlin board integrate it to your existing client's project and then work from there. Yeah. I think the
Speaker 1

Today, 12:14 AM
latter is what I'm more interested in. Okay. Like, you guys as a tech stack.
Yeah. And then experimenting with that.
Speaker 2

Today, 12:14 AM
Okay. Yeah. In that case, that makes sense. Do you have one or two clients that I can probably set up a demo for?
With like, maybe with their consent or maybe you don't need the consent. But what we need but Berlin needs is the integration with search console and Google Analytics.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:15 AM
100%. There are a couple of clients I can do this with.
I can start with smaller clients that I don't have data restrictions So this should be a plan that we can start with very easily.
Speaker 2

Today, 12:15 AM
Okay. Yeah. That should be good enough. One client should be good enough. So what I could do is the this and then set up the demo thing for you and send it to your way. I have a question. So what sort of if I if it comes down to well, I'm trying to pinpoint or angle the pricing. What sort of KPIs that you would look at when you pay for pay for Berlin? What how what point do you think Berlin would worthy the, and what does how does that translate into numbers?
Speaker 1

Today, 12:15 AM
I think it just translates into numbers. Second, I can make sense of like, how much time it saves internally. I see. And which tools I would deliver to my clients as a result of that.
Speaker 2

Today, 12:16 AM
Okay. Okay. Makes sense. Yeah. So we probably can pinpoint something there. So we have so existing agencies, all of them that we work with, because agencies come with the human labor, they are on our low tier $99. Where we Berlin makes a session and their human labor goes and execute. We actually enabled two agencies who does not really have the capability of doing a CRG or whatever Yep. Do it because Berlin makes Berlin has the knowledge, and they just execute. Right? Yep. So but, like, if if you need the automation that tail that we are I I need to angle the price at somewhere, but we can take a look at it. Depends on the client, and especially agency offering. I don't know if per client is something that works with you. Or it's like a package deal. Because we don't charge for per seat because regardless of how many people from your company using Berlin, it's not cost for us. Yep. Right? Yeah.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:17 AM
So for us, I think after before the pricing and stuff, like, you can share whatever pricing works. We can start with two, three seats, but I I would love to just see what the product looks like. Absolutely. See the delta for us, then that will not be the biggest concern for us.
Speaker 2

Today, 12:17 AM
Alright. Yeah. Sounds good. Yeah. So I'll set set set set this up. And then, when do you do you wanna set up a follow-up call? Well, I'll let me let me take a look and then send you an email. With the details.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:17 AM
Yeah. That would be great. Yeah,
Speaker 2

Today, 12:17 AM
please. Alright. This was super, super helpful, man.
Speaker 1

Today, 12:17 AM
Yes, please. Thank you. Bye.
